HUMAN EVALUATION doesn not necessarily mimic the PaperQA methodology (they have access to the internet, not a fixed amount of papers). However, with a big enough corpus of papers, this search can eventually be viewed as the same. 

Also they were financially motivated, which does encourage maximum human performance, but also potential. 

We used the test set. Smaller, therefore more uncertainty in the result. Test set papers are all valid. Did not use full dataset due to cost and time budget.
