            the GM12878 blood cell line are reorganized in the K562 cell line                                       
            (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-4). This finding is significant when compared to other  
            methods, such as TADCompare, HiCcompare, and HiC-DC+, which only identify â‰¤8.256% of GM12878 TADs as    
            reorganized in K562. The benchmarking results highlight the efficacy of DiffDomain in detecting         
            reorganized TADs between these cell lines (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-4).           
                                                                                                                    
            Additionally, the analysis indicates that the majority of identified reorganized TADs have a minimum of 
            43.137%, a median of 81.357%, and a maximum of 98.022% represented by other subtypes                    
            (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-5). This suggests a robust capability of DiffDomain in  
            identifying reorganized TADs, establishing a notable extent of reorganization between GM12878 and K562  
            (hua2024diffdomainenablesidentification pages 4-5).                                                     
                                                                                                                    
            In summary, the percentage of TADs in GM12878 classified as reorganized in K562 by DiffDomain is        
            approximately 30.771%, which aligns with option E in the multiple-choice question.
